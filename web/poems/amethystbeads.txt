<center><b>Amethyst Beads</b></center><br></br>

And when I take them out of <br>
the cherrywood box these beads are <br>
the colour of dog-violets in shadow. Then <br>
at the well of the throat where <br>
tears start <br>
they darken. Now I wear at my neck an old stress <br>
of crystal: an impression of earthly housekeeping. <br>
A mysterious brightness <br>
made underground where there is no sun <br>
only stories of a strayed child and her mother bargaining <br>
with a sullen king. Promising and arguing: <br>
what she can keep, what she can let him have. Shadows <br>
and the season violets start up in are part of <br>
the settlement. Stolen from such a place <br>
these beads cannot be anything <br>
but wise to the healing arts of compromise, <br>
of survival. And when I wear them it is almost <br>
as if my skin was taking into itself <br>
a medicine of light. Something like the old simples. <br>
Rosemary, say, or tansy. <br>
Or camomile which they kept <br>
to cool fever. Which they once used to soothe a child <br>
tossing from side to side, beads of sweat catching <br>
and holding a gleam from the vigil lamp. <br>
A child crying out in her sleep <br>
Wait for me. Donâ€™t leave me here. <br>
Who will never remember this. <br>
Who will never remember this.
