<center><b>Atlantis - A lost Sonnet</b></center><br></br>

How on earth did it happen, I used to wonder <br>
that a whole city—arches, pillars, colonnades, <br>
not to mention vehicles and animals—had all <br>
one fine day gone under? <br></br>

I mean, I said to myself, the world was small then. <br>
Surely a great city must have been missed? <br>
I miss our old city — <br></br>

white pepper, white pudding, you and I meeting <br>
under fanlights and low skies to go home in it. <br>
Maybe what really happened is <br></br>

this: the old fable-makers searched hard for a word <br>
to convey that what is gone is gone forever and <br>
never found it. And so, in the best traditions of <br></br>

where we come from, they gave their sorrow a name <br>
and drowned it. <br>
