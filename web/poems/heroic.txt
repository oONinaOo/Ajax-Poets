<center><b>Heroic</b></center><br></br>

Sex and history. And skin and bone. <br>
And the oppression of Sunday afternoon.<br>
Bells called the faithful to devotion.<br></br>

I was still at school and on my own.<br>
And walked and walked and sheltered from the rain.<br></br>

The patriot was made of drenched stone. <br>
His lips were still speaking. The gun <br>
he held had just killed someone. <br></br>

I looked up. And looked at him again. <br>
He stared past me without recognition. <br></br>

I moved my lips and wondered how the rain <br>
would taste if my tongue were made of stone. <br>
And wished it was. And whispered so that no one <br>
could hear it but him. Make me a heroine.
