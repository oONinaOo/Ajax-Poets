<center><b>The Pomegranate</b></center><br></br>

The only legend I have ever loved is <br>
the story of a daughter lost in hell. <br>
And found and rescued there. <br>
Love and blackmail are the gist of it. <br>
Ceres and Persephone the names. <br>
And the best thing about the legend is <br>
I can enter it anywhere.  And have. <br>
As a child in exile in <br>
a city of fogs and strange consonants, <br>
I read it first and at first I was <br>
an exiled child in the crackling dusk of <br>
the underworld, the stars blighted.  Later <br>
I walked out in a summer twilight <br>
searching for my daughter at bed-time. <br>
When she came running I was ready <br>
to make any bargain to keep her. <br>
I carried her back past whitebeams <br>
and wasps and honey-scented buddleias. <br>
But I was Ceres then and I knew <br>
winter was in store for every leaf <br>
on every tree on that road. <br>
Was inescapable for each one we passed. <br>
And for me. <br>
                    It is winter <br>
and the stars are hidden. <br>
I climb the stairs and stand where I can see <br>
my child asleep beside her teen magazines, <br>
her can of Coke, her plate of uncut fruit. <br>
The pomegranate!  How did I forget it? <br>
She could have come home and been safe <br>
and ended the story and all <br>
our heart-broken searching but she reached <br>
out a hand and plucked a pomegranate. <br>
She put out her hand and pulled down <br>
the French sound for apple and <br>
the noise of stone and the proof <br>
that even in the place of death, <br>
at the heart of legend, in the midst <br>
of rocks full of unshed tears <br>
ready to be diamonds by the time <br>
the story was told, a child can be <br>
hungry.  I could warn her.  There is still a chance. <br>
The rain is cold.  The road is flint-coloured. <br>
The suburb has cars and cable television. <br>
The veiled stars are above ground. <br>
It is another world.  But what else <br>
can a mother give her daughter but such <br>
beautiful rifts in time? <br>
If I defer the grief I will diminish the gift. <br>
The legend will be hers as well as mine.  <br>
She will enter it.  As I have. <br>
She will wake up.  She will hold <br>
the papery flushed skin in her hand. <br>
And to her lips.  I will say nothing. <br>
