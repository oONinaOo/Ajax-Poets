In the worst hour of the worst season <br>
    of the worst year of a whole people <br>
a man set out from the workhouse with his wife. <br>
He was walking – they were both walking – north. <br></br>

She was sick with famine fever and could not keep up. <br>
     He lifted her and put her on his back. <br>
He walked like that west and west and north. <br>
Until at nightfall under freezing stars they arrived. <br></br>

In the morning they were both found dead. <br>
    Of cold. Of hunger. Of the toxins of a whole history. <br>
But her feet were held against his breastbone. <br>
The last heat of his flesh was his last gift to her. <br></br>

Let no love poem ever come to this threshold. <br>
     There is no place here for the inexact <br>
praise of the easy graces and sensuality of the body. <br>
There is only time for this merciless inventory: <br></br>

Their death together in the winter of 1847. <br>
      Also what they suffered. How they lived. <br>
And what there is between a man and woman. <br>
And in which darkness it can best be proved.
